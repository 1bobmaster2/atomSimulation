Alrigt im gonna note some things down in here
K + log level + text is for logging stuff
KASSERT(condition) is for checking if a thing is true and if it is then we continue and if its not we break the app, which means just stopping it
theres also KASSERT_MSG(condition, message), its just the same thing but theres also an additional message that gets printed
and last thing is KASSERT_DEBUG(condition) which is really just the same thing as KASSERT
platform_startup(&state) is the thing that runs when the application starts up
it needs a platform_state which can just be declared like this:
platform_state state;
basically platform_startup creates a window with all the info needed
platform_pump_messages is the thing needed to keep things running nice and clean
platform_shutdown is the thing that basically closes the application
then theres this:
---
void* platform_allocate(u64 size, b8 aligned);
void platform_free(void* block, b8 aligned);
void* platform_zero_memory(void* block, u64 size);
void* platform_copy_memory(void* dest, const void* source, u64 size);
void* platform_set_memory(void* dest, i32 value, u64 size);
---
these weird things are for memory stuff

these stuff:
---
void platform_console_write(const char* message, u8 colour);
void platform_console_write_error(const char* message, u8 colour);
---
these are just for platoform independent writing stuff

f64 platform_get_absolute_time(); is for getting time, crazy right 

void platform_sleep(u64 ms); is for eeping.

today is 17/04/2025 i didnt want to work much so i tried optimizing some code in my unity project but i failed miserably but its alright
then i went over to the game engine and just made some more notes, i accually have no idea what im writing im just following this really
cool tutorial but its ok. also im running out of ideas for the colony i was thinking of starting a new project but i wanna work on this one
for a bit before continuing.
END LOG

LOG
today is 19/04/2025 i coded a bit in my engine im not gonna work on the colony today but i know what im going to add and then im gonna
work on a new unity project because the thing is that i could work on the colony forever, adding more and more stuff but i don't want to
i want to start something new to expand my skills, its going to be a 3d game now and im going to really polish it because looking at the colony
its really like a steaming pile of random stuff but im proud of it its my biggest achievment in game dev.

today is 20/04/2025 i wanted to focus on the colony today because i didnt work on it yesterday, i think ive made some good progress on
it with the max fps thingy, right now im waiting for unity to open because its like so slow it takes 30 seconds to run the project also
it just opened now im going to stop writing soon but also i need to write here that i always make sure to do even a tiniest bit of
coding every day but now ive realized summer is getting closer and closer and i thought to myself what will i do when i go on vacation
and i can't code like theres so many people saying they can't find motivation to start and i can't stop because i need to keep working
on my projects anyways this has been a long entry but it feels good to write down my coding thoughts or something bye
P.S.
ive did the thing i wanted on the colony so now i can relax i wonder if anyone is reading this but idk no one has ever downloaded my game but
thats fine i think my next one is gonna be good

today is 21/04/2025 i wanted to write this after im finished on the colony and atom simulation but look, ive decided to mark the tiles
in the colony as static to improve performance right, so then i decided to set the map size to 1000 by 1000 and not 100 by 100 and i
have literally been waiting for 14 minutes for the colony to run like dude, ill write down in post scriptum how much time did it accually
take but this is crazy. also once im done with the colony i think im gonna work on atom simulation and then relax also as im writing this 
the colony has been trying to load for 16 minutes now.
P.S.
idk how long would it take but as of writing this it has been loading for 43 minutes so this is crazy right

LOG
today is 22/04/2025 i worked a bit on the colony and now im working on atom simulation, ive recently read a bit about data oriented
technology stack it seems pretty cool but one thing i really really hate about it is that you spend so much time setting up all the pararell 
threads and ecs and stuff and then unity tells you nope you cant use unity api to do anything but hey atleast you can do 1 + 1

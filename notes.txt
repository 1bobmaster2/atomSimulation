Alrigt im gonna note some things down in here
K + log level + text is for logging stuff
KASSERT(condition) is for checking if a thing is true and if it is then we continue and if its not we break the app, which means just stopping it
theres also KASSERT_MSG(condition, message), its just the same thing but theres also an additional message that gets printed
and last thing is KASSERT_DEBUG(condition) which is really just the same thing as KASSERT
platform_startup(&state) is the thing that runs when the application starts up
it needs a platform_state which can just be declared like this:
platform_state state;
basically platform_startup creates a window with all the info needed
platform_pump_messages is the thing needed to keep things running nice and clean
platform_shutdown is the thing that basically closes the application
then theres this:
---
void* platform_allocate(u64 size, b8 aligned);
void platform_free(void* block, b8 aligned);
void* platform_zero_memory(void* block, u64 size);
void* platform_copy_memory(void* dest, const void* source, u64 size);
void* platform_set_memory(void* dest, i32 value, u64 size);
---
these weird things are for memory stuff

these stuff:
---
void platform_console_write(const char* message, u8 colour);
void platform_console_write_error(const char* message, u8 colour);
---
these are just for platoform independent writing stuff

f64 platform_get_absolute_time(); is for getting time, crazy right 

void platform_sleep(u64 ms); is for eeping.
